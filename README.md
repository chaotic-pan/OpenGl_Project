# OpenGl_Project

This project was created during a one of my uni courses. The goal was to get familiar with the different functionality of OpenGL, by creating a few 3D-Models and then texture, animate and shaded them with a Phong Shader.

I later used the same Project to complete a Refractoring assignment, and practiced using diffrent Design Patterns and appling the Object-Oriented Programming Principles.
